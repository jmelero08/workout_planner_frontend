Workout Planner. 

This is an app where anybody can go to and see workout plans that other people have created. The workouts are a part of a category (chest, back, legs or arms) and the users can add a picture if they would like. This is a very simple app at the moment. Users can not log in and anybody can edit a workout. In the future a user login feature can be added. 

TO Start:

Run "rails s" in the terminal for the backend/api, this can be found at https://github.com/jmelero08/workout_planner_backend. Once the server is running, user can input "open index.html" in the termianl for this front-end repo, which will the open the app in the browser. 

Contributing:

Please feel free to contribute to the app with new ideas or improvments. Just fork, clone and submit a PR.
